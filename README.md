# SQL Corporate

SQL Corporate covers the basics of working with SQL and to know to interact with database management systems and create powerful relational databases!

The ER-Diagram is based on following requirements of Corporate. And further queried into SQL.

The business is divided into branches. Each branch has a unique number, a name, and is managed by a specific employee.
The company makes money by selling to customers. Each client is identified by a name and a unique number.
Employees are the company's foundation. Every employee has a name, a birthday, a gender, a salary, and a unique number.
An employee can only work for one branch at a time, and each branch is managed by one of its employees. We'll also want to know when the current manager took over as manager.
An employee can supervise other employees at the branch, and an employee can also supervise employees at other branches. An employee can only have one supervisor.
A branch may handle a number of clients, each with its own name and identification number. Only one branch may handle a single client at a time.
Employees can sell items to clients controlled by their branch. Multiple employees can work with the same client if necessary. We'll want to keep track of how much each employee sells to each client with whom they work.
To purchase inventory, many branches will need to collaborate with suppliers. We'll keep track of each supplier's name and the type of product they sell to the branch. A single supplier may provide products to several branches.
